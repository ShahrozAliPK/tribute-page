                    This is my tribute to all the parents around the globe who have worked very hard
                    just for the sake of their children to be nicest person on the Earth.The dedication
                    of the parents for their continuous hardwork till their last breath is speechless, I
                    mean no power on the Earth could be able to compete with their willingness for the
                    goals they decided to accomplish for their child.After becoming parents, the emotions and
                    feelings of both mother and father are changed, they try to provide everything to their
                    child literally everything! Their goals,dreams,career,mind-set,feelings and bondings
                    have moved to something big which can't be described by the parents themselves.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    From toys to pencil till clothing, parents try to provide every luxury to their child
                    as far as they can and as much faster as they can, I mean if travelling faster than
                    speed of light would be possible than surely parents won't stop moving with such a speed
                    so they can quickly get back to their child to hand him over his favourite toy which
                    he demanded just a few seconds back.

                    There is no end to conclusion on this topic as it is the most valuable and priceless topic
                    to discuss.No scientist, physicist, mathematician, doctor, pilot, business man etc can compete
                    with the level of hardwork and patience which parents possesses.I mean, literally no one!
                    Think about a second how far and long can you stop yourself from not taking a single bite
                    of some super tasty crunch burger spiced with sauces and chillies lying in front of your
                    table and you are in a great hunger for about 8 hours? This is just a glimpse of what and
                    how parents keep their lips compressed and not saying a single word as it could ruin the
                    craviness and hunger of their child.

                    So, before the page ends up, I would like to end my topic with the following quote for
                    all the parents around the globe who have done more than being a <b>PARENT</b>
